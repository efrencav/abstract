                    either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal
                    information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
                    information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

                    your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for
                    recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to
                    DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be
                    tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we
                    will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy policy.
