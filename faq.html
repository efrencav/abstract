              </p>
              <p>We take great pride in delivering an excellent level of service at all times. We listen carefully to
                what our clients want to achieve and work closely with them to make sure their objectives are met.</p>
              <p>Our clients tell us they like our style and approach: clear lines of communication, a single point of
                contact and work of a consistently high standard – all delivered under the watchful eye of Megan, our
                Creative Director. What’s more, we offer excellent value for your money and have a portfolio to be proud
                of.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="service-detail__subtitle">How much will this cost?</div>
            <div class="service-detail__text">
              <p>We understand, money doesn't grow on trees, so knowing what this will
                cost is crucial in determining who you choose as your design agency.</p>
              <p>Great design is an investment, it is something that takes dedication and time and because all projects
                are different from each other, there is not a standard set price for our work. We create custom,
                value-based proposals for all projects because every client is unique and has different needs. We often
                ask our clients what their budget is to determine what we can offer for services that will fit within
                this budget.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, it is so important for us to see our clients grow and to see their ROI come back
                tenfold as their business takes off. We like to provide a range for our pricing as projects differ from
                each other and what is needed. We are not a "$5 logo" kind of studio. We do not believe that the budget
                logo will benefit your business in anyway and can often hurt your image.</p>
              <p>Our pricing is based on the time we invest into your company. Our projects start with days in research
                and strategy. We then collaborate with you on a custom Pinterest board and create mood boards to set the
                tone. From that point, we spend weeks in design mode, creating custom concepts and brand applications
                for you to review. Our websites also receive tons of love and attention as we create custom sites in
                Adobe XD that are then built in Squarespace or Shopify and are accompanied with a video tutorial we
                create for you to learn how to edit your new site. So as you can see, we invest our time into your
                business as if it is our own because nothing is more powerful to us than having our clients share with
                their family and friends, just how much they enjoyed working with us and how their business has grown
                since we worked with them.</p>
              <p>As a ballpark reference, our pricing is as follows:<br>
                <strong class="orange">Branding Packages</strong> - We offer a few options for packages with our
                branding to provide you with what you need for your business. Our branding will cost you around
                $2000-$6500 for a custom package. Our pricing is also based on the size of your business. We do not
                charge small start-ups the same as a large established business due to the fact that their needs are
                very different from each other.
              </p>
              <p><strong class="orange">Package Design</strong> - Our package design is based on an hourly basis as most
                all clients have different needs. Our hourly rate is $100/hr and in in general, most of our package
                design work takes around 5-25 hours depending on the complexity of the design work.</p>
              <p><strong class="orange">Website Design</strong> - We design and develop informational based
                websites, portfolio based sites and online shops. We have a team of talented developers who can
                customize any site to your needs. Just like our other services, there is a range for our websites as
                some of our clients require a more complex and custom website. We have a copywriter and photographers to
                help you develop your content as well. Their pricing would depend on what is needed from them. A general
                ballpark for a custom website design and build is around $2500-$10,000+ and would depend on what your
                business requires for functionality, integrations, sales etc.</p>
              <p><strong class="orange">Discounts</strong> - We do offer a discount when you select multiple
                packages! We do offer other services such as social media design, SEO, product designs, copywriting,
                photography and more. These would require a custom proposal.</p>
            </div>

          </div>
          <div>
            <div class="service-detail__subtitle">How long will this take?</div>
            <div class="service-detail__text">
              <p>We can tell you one thing, you can’t get your logo next week, we’re sorry but that is not how we roll.
                We spend a significant amount of time getting to know you and your business. We spend time in research
                and strategy, in design mode, rounds of feedback and edits, finalizing packages with brand manuals and
                launching websites, so it all adds up and takes our upmost attention. On average, our projects take
                around 4-6 weeks yet for larger projects, it can take 2-3 months to complete.
              </p>
              <p> It is crucial that our clients be ready to rock n’ roll when a project kicks off, that means we ask
                that our clients not sign a contract with us to begin work if they are planning some major life changes
                as that can hinder the process and workflow. If you are going on vacation (take us with you!), having a
                baby soon (congrats if you are!) or planning on moving (we hope it is some place warm!), we ask that you
                wait until we can have your undivided attention for your project.</p>

          </div>
          <div>
            <div class="service-detail__subtitle">What should I do to get ready?</div>
            <div class="service-detail__text">
              <p>Well first and foremost, it’s time to celebrate! Not everyone takes branding and web design seriously
                and often look beyond its importance to find the best deal around. We want you to know you have made a
                wonderful choice and we want to welcome you to the family. Now, let’s look at what you may need to line
                up for your upcoming projects with us:
              </p>
              <p><strong class="orange">Website</strong> - You can gather your content for your project. This means if
                you have copy already developed,
                you can set up a Google Doc to share with us. If you need assistance with copywriting, this is a great
                time to let us know so that we can set that up for you. We will also need your imagery. We prefer you
                share these by folder so it is easier for us to sort through and share via Google Drive. Website imagery
                should be around 2600 px wide, any smaller and it will be blurry on larger screens.</p>
              <p>If your site is going to be an online shop, it is a great time to square away info such as product
                pricing, taxes, shipping, weight and dimensions to have ready to go when we request that info. This is
                also a great time to purchase a domain if you do not have one, set up business email accounts and signup
                for Stripe and Paypal for your checkout portion of your website. Squarespace and Shopify have built in
                SSL certificates so you do not need to set this up with your bank.</p>
              <p><strong class="orange">Branding</strong> - We will start with a Pinterest board that we will
                collaborate on with you so if you wish to
                start compiling designs you love and hate, that will help us in these beginning stages. With any
                project, it is important that you understand your target audience. If you are uncertain as to who that
                is, this is a great time to figure out those things. </p>
              <p><strong class="orange">Packaging</strong> - For package design, we need a dieline to apply our products
                to. If you have an existing
                print company you work with, this would be a great time to request dielines, print specifications and
                other important info we should know about. If you do not have a print company in mind yet, please let us
                know so that we can put you in touch with ones we recommen</p>

          </div>
          <div>
            <div class="service-detail__subtitle">How do payments work?</div>
            <div class="service-detail__text">
              <p>For all of our projects, we require a 50% retainer due at the beginning of a project. If your project
                is under $500, your invoice will need to be paid in full before we start. From the initial retainer, we
                then set up a payment schedule as elements of your package are completed. At the end of the project,
                once the scope of work is complete, we will send your final invoice and then you will receive your
                deliverables and your website can go live.
              </p>
              <p>If you wish to set up a payment plan, we can accomodate and setup automatic monthly withdrawals. Your
                project will be broken down into 4 payments with the last payment due before you receive your
                deliverables or your website goes live.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <div class="service-detail__subtitle">Do you travel for projects?</div>
            <div class="service-detail__text">
              <p>Of course we do! We love to see your business in person and for our spatial design projects, it is
                important for us to come to your location for us to work on interior styling, exterior design, mural
                design and signage. Though it is not mandatory that we see your location before we start designing, we
                do create our murals in person and our travel time would be factored into your proposa
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <div class="service-detail__subtitle">Do you work with clients around the world or solely in the US?</div>
            <div class="service-detail__text">
              <p>That is the great thing about technology and things like Zoom Video calls, we can work with any client
                in any timezone! We have clients in Paris, London, Dubai, Exumas and all over the US. We try our best to
                work indifferent timezones so do not worry about that! We create websites that feature multiple
                languages and currencies as well in addition to creating design in multiple languages for your target
                audiences.</p>
